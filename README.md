# howto
A collection of code snippets, notebooks, scripts, etc. that are useful.

A couple things:
- I've setup the requirements and dependencies separate for each folder at this level. E.g. `basics` has it's own requirements for building a virtualenv to run the notebooks. 
- Review the setup.md file in each folder for instructions on configuring your local environment.

This repository is primarily intended to capture useful things I end up doing across different roles and systems. I hope to grow it to cover more complex explanatory scenarios that will be covered in blog posts too.

If you find it useful, please let me know!

The various folders included are described in more detail below.
