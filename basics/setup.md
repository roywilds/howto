# Introduction
This folder contains simple, self-contained notebooks and scripts that cover common activities I encounter as a data scientist.

# Instructions
For simplicity, I'm assuming you're using python3 and are familiar with virtualenv. I'm not an Anaconda user, so this is mostly written around using pip and virtualenv. If not, check out the `virtualenv_usage.md` file.
